Summary
-------

This course is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current research around sulfur biogeochemistry and astrobiology. During the regular class session, we will analyze two to three papers in a discussion-based format. Each class will conclude with a brief outline of the following week's class introduced by the instructors, or at the beginning of the class for sessions lead by guest lecturers.

Topics
------

*   Origin of mass-dependent, mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation
*   Global sulfur cycles, past and present
*   Role of sulfur in organic diagenesis, and petroleum generation
*   Sulfur isotope biosignatures in early Earth rocks and Martian meteorites
*   Diagnostic lipids for sulfidic oceans
*   Molecular biology of sulfur metabolisms
*   Sulfur isotope record and the early Earth's atmosphere
*   Dimethylsulfides and other atmospheric sulfur gases
